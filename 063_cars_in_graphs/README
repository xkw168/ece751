Thanks for your time to review my code.

Here is a basic introduction of my code, my program will accept two inputs, the
first one will specify a graph and the second one will specify a list of cars
(their destination and source). The main focuse of my program is parse these
two files and use dijkstras algorithm to find the best path from s(ource) to
d(estiantion) for each car.

Because the traffic condition of each road is dynamic changing, so I will do
dijkstras for each car once they arrive at a new step, to find out what's the
best next "node" to go.

All my code is declared in studentinterface.hpp and implemented
in studentinterface.cpp.

Here is some question I have, will you kindly review them
while looking through the code:

1. Do you have any recommendation/suggestion for my dijkstras implementation?
(from the performance viewpoint)
2. Do you have any recommendation/suggestion for my whole program?
(from the documentation & code quality viewpoint)

Becasue this is only a course project, the main focuse is correctness, but I think
in industry area, all correctness, performance, code quality etc. are important.
Right now, I think I can write the "right" code, but may be not the "best" code
(performance, quality etc.). Thanks for reading, have a nice day!
